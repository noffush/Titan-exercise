## Titan exercise

This is my solution to the Fullstack home assignment.

## Installation instructions

1. clone the repo
2. run 'npm install'
3. create a .env file in the root folder, and add:
  i.  your Pixabay API key (key is PIXABAY_API_KEY)
  ii. the url to your Mongo DB (key is MONGODB_URI)
4. test the postman routes as you wish

** Note I ran out of time and did not manage to complete the last exercise

Thanks,
